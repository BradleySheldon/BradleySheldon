### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, 
I'm Bradley from St. Louis Missouri, and I am currenty a Computer Science major at Saint Louis University. I really enjoy learning differnt languages, as well as developing my own code as a hobby and possibly a future career. So far most of my projects have been in either Python or C++. Most of which have been simple yet popular games I've made for fun and practice.

Skills: Python, C++, RStudio

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this page.
